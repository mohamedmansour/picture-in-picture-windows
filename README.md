Windows Picture In Picture
===========================

This was created in 2008 from my frustration after purchasing my first big screen tv. In my house, we never owned a big screen TV. My PC was positioned in a dedicated room with three other computers, and the TV was right behind the wall.

I really wanted to play movies on my big screen TV, so I bought this long HDMI cable for 5 dollars that connected my PC to the TV. Then I used VLC (Video Lan) to play the movie. It was frustrating moving the VLC player from my primary display to the secondary display. I had to figure out when to click on the video frame to go full screen, or figure out how to forward to a certain scene quickly since the keyboard shortcuts were slow. 

When my cousin came over to checkout our new TV, I had to get my brother to help me know where the cursor is. So he told me to move the mouse up, down, left, right, and it was quite funny, but frustrating. Then I was like "screw it, let me code something quickly, just give me 30 minutes", He was laughing at me, they really wanted to watch the movie, so they went upstairs to make the popcorn. 

When they came back downstairs, it was working :) The look in their faces were amazed, cause they are not tech people, and saw a problem we were having solved with a couple of lines of code.

That is why I love my profession, Software Engineering. I get to create anything I want, with any language I choose, to solve a frustrating problem, simple problem, in a matter of minutes.


So that is why I created this, it is funny looking back at the code and see how ugly I did it. It was just a 30 minute hack, and it works. Right now I have Xbox 360 and DNLA support so I don't have to control my screen from a secondary device from my static PC :)
